## About 

As the name of the library suggests, it's simply another React library.  
So then what's the motivation, you may ask. Well, when I saw Hacktoberfest 2019 was around the corner, 
I was looking at what I could contribute to this year. For me I find it daunting to find a repository where I can contribute  
at my own level. The projects I had encountered were either too basic or way too advanced. 

I wanted to create a repository that people from beginner to advanced could contribute in a meaningful way. (Myself included obviously)

Oh and I was able to get this project up and running by using `nwb`, which is an npm package for creating npm packages. So if you want to make your own React library and open source it, I advise checking them out.
